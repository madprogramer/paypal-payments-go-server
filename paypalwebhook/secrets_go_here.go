package paypalwebhook

//If this a fresh installation of paypalwebhook
//Make a copy of this file called `secrets.go`
//If you don't want to name it `secrets.go` you can use any other name you like,
//as long as you remember to add it to your .gitignore to avoid publicly committing secrets.

//Next, comment this var statement

/*var(
	clientID = ""
	secretID = ""
	webhookID = ""
	apiMode = ""
)*/

//Then uncomment the lines below
//and fill in all the fields

/*
